# Fuel Economy of Automatic vs. Manual Transmission Cars (in 1974!)
### using the mtcars dataset in the R datasets package

This directory contains the final project completed for the Regression Models course in the John Hopkins University Data Science Specialization on Coursera. The goal of the project was to use the mtcars dataset in the R datasets package to determine whether and automatic transmission or a manual transmission was better for fuel economy and to quantify the difference in fuel economy between the two types of transmission.
